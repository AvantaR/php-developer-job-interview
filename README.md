Here is a short list of example questions for candidates for a PHP developer position. It's a handy cheat sheet for me when I lead the job interview. The list is divided into few parts covering issues from different scopes. Workflow questions are not straightly connected with programming, but I like to have the whole picture of the working culture of a candidate.

If you have any good questions which aren't present on the list, feel free to contribute!
